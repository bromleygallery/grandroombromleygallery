      We want nothing more than to bring your special day to life, celebrate your individuality and create memories for your guests. 
      
      
      We believe no two weddings should ever be the same. 
      
      
      Our space allows for a range of entertainment, innovative food stations, floral installations and a dance floor. Work alongside our experienced event planners who have established relationships with a wide network within the industry, including the finest DJ’s, musicians and talented photographers, to ensure that every aspect of your wedding is exceptional.
      
      
      Our kitchen team can work with you to create an elevated menu that tells your unique story, incorporating seasonal produce. We are committed to creating a menu that is as meaningful as it is delicious. Cocktails are on point and our extensive wine cellar offers a wide range suited to all tastes.
