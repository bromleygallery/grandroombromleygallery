  Hailing from Scotland, Stephen’s Nairn’s 20-year career in the Hospitality industry began at home, where he honed his skills in renowned European kitchens before receiving a scholarship to work at Eleven Madison Park in New York. Intrigued by Melbourne's dining scene, he made Australia his home, rising to Executive Chef at Vue de Monde and later serving as Head Chef at Estelle by Scott Pickett.

Nairn was a finalist for The Age Good Food Guide's “Chef of The Year” in 2023.
