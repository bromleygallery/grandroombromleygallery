  Joining LK Hospitality as Executive Chef in 2018, Nairn is now Culinary Director, overseeing a team of 120 employees. A finalist at The Age Good Food Guide’s Chef Of The Year in 2023, Nairn is a well-respected member of the Australian hospitality community. Nairn’s restaurants, Omnia Bistro & Bar and Yugen Dining, were awarded two chef hats each. Born in the west coast of Scotland, Stephen Nairn’s skills were developed in some of Glasgow and Edinburgh’s most rigid and exacting European kitchens. His hard work, perseverance and diligence paid off, and after seven years in Scotland, Nairn was chosen for a scholarship in New York, where he joined the impressive team at Daniel Humm’s world-renowned 3 Michelin starred Eleven Madison Park. The desire to continue travelling and constant whispers of Melbourne’s exciting dining scene led him to Australia. The freedom, diversity and energy of Australia’s culinary landscape had him hooked and the country has since become home. In his three years at Vue de monde, Nairn rose from sous chef to Executive chef, running one of Australia’s most demanding kitchens. Then followed two years as head chef at Estelle by Scott Pickett, which took him through to the opening of Matilda. During this period, Nairn’s desire to explore his own creative identity grew. In late 2018 Nairn joined LK Hospitality as Executive Chef, overseeing the food and beverage concepts for the new luxury residential precinct Capitol Grand in South Yarra.
  With a 20-year career in the hospitality industry, Nairn brings a wealth of industry knowledge and expertise as Culinary Director and Executive Chef of LK Hospitality.
  Nairn is responsible for the menu creation and logistics for Omnia Bistro & Bar, Yūgen Dining, Yūgen Tea Bar and The Grand room and Bromley gallery. Nairn’s respect for seasonality and the best quality produce, combined with a mastery of craft and commitment to producing the most delicious dishes for his guests.
